<p>We shall remake an iconic plot showing spikes in the number of COVID cases from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html">New York Times</a> using ggplot. We start from the data <a href="https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/tree/master">here</a>. And we get the quarto workflow for free that allows anyone else to quickly understand and reproduce this + build on it!</p>
<p>Here’s the plot we are going to make</p>

<p>Load all necessary packages upfront.</p>
<p>(<strong><em>Automated check to install packages</em></strong>) If there is a package being called with <code>library('pkg')</code> or <code>pkg::function()</code> when it is not installed, Rstudio automatically prompts above that the package is not installed. So you can quickly install in by clicking on the <code>install</code> button here</p>
<p><img src="../assets/package_install_warning.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>(<em>old school method</em>): If using the <code>install.packages</code> command within a <code>R</code> chunk in <code>.qmd</code>, remember you don’t want to run the install.packages every single time, only the first time to download the package. Comment the install.packages to prevent it from being rerun every time you knit/Render the <code>.qmd</code> while leaving a record of what was installed for future readers of the file.</p>
<p><em>Side note</em>: To check that you have the package downloaded, go to <code>Packages</code> tab (near <code>files/Plots</code>) and search the package name! (<em>loaded packages with</em> <code>library()</code> <em>will have a checkmark next to them)</em></p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="polish-the-plot-bells-whistles">Polish the plot (bells &amp; whistles)</h2>
<p>You can think of this as the cilantro or garnishing on your dish but without this your plots will only be half as useful to communicate to anyone but yourself!</p>
<p>Now let us polish the plot elements to be more <strong>presentable</strong> and <strong>explanatory</strong> using these references</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2-specs.html">ggplot2-specs</a> is a good reference to know the options that can be tweaked to change plot elements.</li>
<li>Refer to <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/aes_colour_fill_alpha.html">colour related aesthetics</a></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Changes needed on the plot</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Colour the line red</p>
<ul>
<li>Fill in the area below the trendline light red (<em>hint: use</em> <code>geom_area()</code> <em>instead of</em> <code>geom_line()</code> <em>; and use</em> <code>fill = 'red'</code> <em>but add a transparency of 0.2 using</em> <code>alpha = 0.2</code><em>!).</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>x-axis labels : add months, mentioned in the middle (<em>figure out how to do this, not in the solution script)</em></p></li>
<li><p>add annotation on the largest peak that says <code>7-day average</code> . Can make more controlled/detailed annotations with the <a href="https://ggforce.data-imaginist.com/index.html">ggforce::</a> package</p></li>
<li><p>adjust the plot background and gridlines using <code>theme()</code> family of functions</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Add <code>theme_classic()</code> switch to light background with no gridlines <em>(there are a variety of different base themes you can choose from as a starting point!)</em></p></li>
<li><p>Then add your own gridlines and format numbers on the y-axis the way NYT likes them</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
