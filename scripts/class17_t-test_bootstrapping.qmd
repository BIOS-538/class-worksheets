## We are working with iris data

Familiarize yourself with the [data](https://www.statology.org/iris-dataset-r/)!

::: aside
We will use `iris` data. We are interesting the `sepal.length` column, and it's difference across 2 different species

## Setup

Loading libraries and such

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse) # data manipulation + plotting
iris <- iris # get dataset into environment
```

## Processing data a.k.a. data wrangling

Apart from the identifiers, we only need the `Sepal.Length` column. And we need to `filter` out only 2 species: `virginica` and `versicolor`. We need only 2 species *since t-test can only compare 2 things ; for more explore doing ANOVA below)*

```{r data-wrangle}
# finished data wrangling
```

## Do a t-test

Use the R function `t.test()` to do a t-test. Explore the parameters within this function and see how the P-values change when you change them. Important one is the `alternative` ; try going between `two-sided`, `less` and `greater` and understand the results

```{r}

```

### Try doing ANOVA on all 3 species!

## Do bootstrapping

Remember: Bootstrapping involves -

-   Sampling with replacement. Here you need to resample within each of the 2 species types

    -   Your re-sample will be the same size as your sample!

-   Calculating a summary statistic from each bootstrapped sample. The statistic in this case is the `difference in the means` of the two different species' bootstrap samples.

-   Iterating this process many times. Here we will use 10,000 times

Outline your algorithm here

-   It is very helpful to write out or draw a flow chart

-   You need to see what needs to be done in your own language

-   Before you explain it to the computer in the R language!
:::

```{r bootstrapping}


```

## Plot histogram

Show the histogram of the means of the bootstrapping excercise

## Calculate p-value from the bootstrapping

You want to area under the subset of the histogram where 0 intersects

## Doing this quicker using `moderndive` functions

I don't know how to do this yet, but this [moderndive textbook](https://moderndive.com/7-sampling.html#what-proportion-of-this-bowls-balls-are-red)might help both of us figure it out!
